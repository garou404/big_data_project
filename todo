Map reduce or scala?

coutries where running is popular
-> groupby country per different athlete
-> same for age_group

proportion of people running
-> get nb of peaple per country (find other dataframe on 2019-2020)
[x] : find countries population dataset
[x] : preprocess the dataset
->get different people running per country/people per country


average distance per user
-> groupby mean
-> different major the person ran


all-time performance
-> distance > 5, 10, 21, etc and lowest time
-> compute the number of following days that a person ran (i don't know how to do that yet)
